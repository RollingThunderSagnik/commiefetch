### Hi, fellow commie! 

**commiefetch** is a command-line communist information tool written in `python` and `bash` that displays communist statistics directly on your terminal. commiefetch is an online tool - it requires internet access for complete functionality. 

Contributions are very welcome! You can help it by contributing scripts - maybe the price of guillotine in the user's country, triangulating the current location of Zizek, etc.
